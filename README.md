## âœ… React Course Completed!

ðŸŽ‰ I've officially completed the entire React course!  
From static pages to full interactivity with forms, APIs, and hooks â€” this journey has been transformative.

## ðŸ”œ Whatâ€™s Next

I'm now planning to:

- Start building full-stack projects using React + external APIs
- Explore advanced patterns like context, reducers, and custom hooks
- Learn TypeScript for safer React development
- Dive into backend technologies (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)
- Deploy professional-level React apps
